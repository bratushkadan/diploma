# 3. Partial SEED(S)

Date: 2025-02-22

## Status

Accepted

## Context

There's a need for an evolutionary project design and documentation framework.

## Decision

Use (partial) SEED(S). All of the features from SEED(S) is welcome for each microservice, except for the excess sequence diagrams for **each** service, which is deemed to be an overkill in this project.

## Consequences

More resources are needed to follow SEED(S), however, services will have a more robust design.
